This is the official implementation of the synthesis project 2 on the IDISC challenge.

 ### Introduction
This project aims to revolutionize certified translations using cutting-edge technology. Understanding the laborious nature of traditional certified translations, our goal is to simplify and automate
crucial processes, improving efficiency, accuracy, and user satisfaction for translators and clients alike.  

We introduce a multimodal system capable of automatically identify and convert a photo or scan of a physical document into an editable format, while preserving the legal validity and
visual integrity of elements like stamps and signatures. Integration with Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tools and implementation of automated quality checks, we aim to reduce
processing times and costs associated with certified translations drastically.
